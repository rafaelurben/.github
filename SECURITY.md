# Rafael's Security Policy

This policy is relevant for all of `rafaelurben`'s repositories.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not report security issues as normal GitHub issues. Security issues are considered confidential until a fix is released.

If available, you can use GitHub's "Report a Vulnerability" feature to report a vulnerability. This can be found in the "Security" tab on repositories where this feature is enabled.

If this feature is not enabled or you cannot use it, please [contact me via email](https://go.rafaelurben.ch/devmail).

Thank you for your report! I take security issues seriously and will try to respond as soon as possible.

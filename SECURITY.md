# Reporting Security Issues

Please do not report security issues as normal issues.

If available, you can use GitHub's "Report a Vulnerability" feature to report a vulnerability.

If not, please [contact me via email](https://go.rafaelurben.ch/devmail).

Thank you for your report! I take security issues seriously and will try to respond as soon as possible.
